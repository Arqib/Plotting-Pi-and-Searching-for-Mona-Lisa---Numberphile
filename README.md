# Plotting-Pi-and-Searching-for-Mona-Lisa---Numberphile
Plotting Pi and Searching for Mona Lisa - Numberphile python source code.

After watching this video "Plotting Pi and Searching for Mona Lisa - Numberphile" I looked for the source code but I could not find what I was looking for. I therefore wrote the code and this repository is where you will find it.

# How to run
Clone this repository, cd into it and then run
$ python3 numberphile.py
